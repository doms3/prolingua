Making coding accessible to those who speak different languages - UBCHacks 2017 

Won 'Best Hack Submitted on a .tech Domain'

### Our Goal
In the developed world we often take out access to technology for granted but there are many groups in the developing world and even in isolated, marginalized communities in our own country who strugggle to gain access to technology. For many of these already disadvantaged groups, there is yet another barrier to success. 

Most, if not all, of the common programming languages in use today are created with english syntax and for the members of those communities who are not english speaking, this is huge disadvantage for entering the coding community. With prolingua, we would like to offer a simple programming language that can easily have key syntactic terms given in multiple languages. For a list of languages we currently support, please see the supported-languages folder!
